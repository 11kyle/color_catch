Color Catch

Come play this game built with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I named it Color Catch. The objective is to catch the balls before they hit the ground. Be sure you match the paddle color to the ball color or lose one of your three lifes. Lose all lives and it's game over! Good luck and have fun!

This game was super fun to create. I used the HTML5 canvas tag to create the game. CSS3 was used for some custom styles and animations. JavaScript controlled the mouse and keyboard controls, collision detections and score handling.
